There was a story that Bill Gates personally prefer lazy people for important jobs in Microsoft because they can give  briliant solutions. As humorious as it is, I feel that it's kinda right. 

In any kind of work, "make it a habit" is one way to improve productivity. It reduce the "unneccessary" thinking part that decelerate the dicision making. It also increase the syncronazation of body parts. 

However, the problem of "make it a habit" is that it also reduce the desire for innovation. When we are too familiar with a job , we are less likely want to change. We are tend to pick a familiar route to drive on to where we already know, even if it may not be a shortest route. Eventually, we lock ourselve in our comfort cage.
