There was a story that Bill Gates personally prefer lazy people for important jobs at Microsoft because they can give brilliant solutions. As humorous as it is, there is a reliable lesson that we can learn from it. 

In any kind of work, "make it a habit" is one way to improve efficiency. It reduces the "unnecessary" thinking part that decelerates the decision making. It also increases the synchronization of body parts.

However, the problem of "make it a habit" is that although it makes you work faster in the short term, it also reduces the desire for innovation. When we are too familiar with a job, we are less likely want to change. We tend to pick a familiar route to drive on to where we already know, even if it may not be the shortest route. Eventually, we lock ourselves in our comfort cage.
