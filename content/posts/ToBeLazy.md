There was a story that Bill Gates personally prefer lazy people for important jobs in Microsoft because they can give  briliant solutions. As humorious as it is, I feel that it's kinda right in a sense that lazy is hard to get into habit. 

In any kind of work, make it a habit is one way to improve productivity. It reduce the "unneccessary" thinking part that does not contribute to result. However, the problem of "make it a habit" is that it's alsro reduce the desire of innovation. When we are too familiar with a job , we are less likely want to change.
