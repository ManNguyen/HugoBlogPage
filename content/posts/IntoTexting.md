I think the best way to get into writing is by texting. Recently, I texted a lot to express my ideas and stories to a friend. And it's refreshing. Vague thoughts that you buried in your brain become clearer. Suddenly you understand yourself better. 
Under the pressure of expression, scattering bit of information that you hold crystallizes to sentences. Or just a sentence. A word!
Unlike writing, the act of texting segmentize your cloud of thoughts to different sacs that can be combined into different sentences. So it requires less effort and is easier to get into. 
I tried to get into writing numerous times. But every time I sat in front of the computer, I don't know where to begin with. I tried to think about the whole picture and then tried to divide it into paragraphs, then tried to strategize different approaches,etc. All in my head. That enormous work of creativity just too much for me to handle and my mind goes blank.
But now, I'm sitting here on a bus, on a trembling platform, in the middle of a crowded street, texting this to myself. But somehow, it feels very enjoyable. :)
