Finally, I got myself a personal blog/website using Hugo Framework. It's been a little bit time consuming to set up, but oh boy isn't it look nice.
I've always wanted to have a personal blog, but not until recently, I realized that I truly want to have a blog.

Last year, I made a website for the sole purpose of getting to the employer's eyes and it didn't get me far. A blog shouldn't be like that, it shouldn't be just a show-off piece.  A blog is a place to show your expression, thinking, experience to the whole world. With that view, I decided to put away my old site with the corny domain and start over again using a completely new framework. And then we got this site.

My techs: 

Hugo to generate statics site,

A beautiful theme got from HTML5up website (it's free)

Host it using GitHub pages.

Using Hubot to automate the build/deploy process.

Thank you for visiting :)
