Finally, I got myself a personal blog/website using Hugo Framework. It's been a litle bit time consuming to setting up, but oh boy isn't it look nice.
I've always wanted to have a personal blog, but not until recently , I realized that I truly want to have a blog.

Last year, I made a website for the sole purpose of getting to employer's eyes and it didn't get me far. A blog shouldn't be like that, it shouldn't be just a show off piece.  A blog is a place to show your expression, thinking, experience to the whole world. With that view, I decided to put away my old site with the corny domain  and start over again using a completly new framework. And then we got this site...

My techs: 

Hugo to generate statics site,
A beautiful theme got from HTML5up website ( it's free to use)
Host it using github pages.
Using Hubot to automate build/deploy process.
cost to operate: 
domain name :  $
Linode : $ /month

Thank you for visiting :)
